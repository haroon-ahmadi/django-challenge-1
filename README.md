**django-challenge-1**
\
Can you find the bug?
\
\
The home page of this app was meant to show the start and the end day of the current week. But the careless programmer wrote buggy code.
\
\
This is a basic challenge and it is meant to test your ability to read other people's code.
\
There is a bug in app_1/views.py. Read it and fix the bug. Please don't rewrite the whole function because if you do, then it means you couldn't read and understand the code.
\
\
Send us a pull request with the bug fixed.
\
\
You need to have these skills to do this task:
- [ ] git (clone, send pull requests)
- [ ] python
- [ ] pipenv
- [ ] Django (working with env file, adding SECRET_KEY)

* The code was actually a part of a real project
